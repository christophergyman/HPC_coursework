#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int i, j, k;
    int outer_n = 10; // Adjust the size of the outer loop as needed
    int inner_n = 100; // Adjust the size of the inner loops as needed

    // Parallelize the nested loops using collapse
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j, k) shared(outer_n, inner_n)
    for (i = 0; i < outer_n; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < inner_n; j++) {
            for (k = 0; k < inner_n; k++) {
                // Do computation for the inner loops
            }
        }

        // After the inner loops are done, do computation for the outer loop
    }

    return 0;
}

In this modification:

    The collapse(2) clause combines the two inner loops into one, effectively flattening them into a single loop.
    The outer loop (i) remains outside of the parallel region, ensuring that only the combined inner loops are parallelized.

This way, you achieve parallelism without introducing nested parallel regions, which may lead to performance issues.



#include <stdio.h>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
    int i, j;
    int n = 100;

    // Attempting to collapse loops with data dependency
    #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) private(i, j) shared(n)
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            // Do computation dependent on the value of 'i'
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

In this example, the inner loop's iteration depends on the value of the outer loop's iteration variable i. Collapsing these loops using collapse(2) would not resolve this data dependency issue. Parallelizing such code directly would risk incorrect results or even undefined behavior due to data races or incorrect order of execution.

In cases where there are data dependencies between iterations of collapsed loops, it's important to analyze the dependencies and redesign the algorithm or parallelization strategy accordingly to ensure correctness. Sometimes, it might be necessary to sacrifice parallelism in favor of preserving correctness and avoiding data races.
